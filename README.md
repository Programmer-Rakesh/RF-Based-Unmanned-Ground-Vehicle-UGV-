## 📌 Project Overview
This project documents the **iterative development of a Radio Frequency (RF)–controlled Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV)** designed to operate in **offline, communication-denied environments**.

Instead of relying on internet, GPS, or cellular networks, the UGV uses **direct RF communication**, making it suitable for defense, disaster response, and search-and-rescue applications.

**Status:** Completed ✅

- Laptop-based W/A/S/D control
- Raspberry Pi used as RF transmitter
- Arduino handled motor control
- Achieved ~8 meters range (low battery)

**Observations:**
- Straight motion stable
- Turning behavior inconsistent compared to wired prototype

---

### 🔹 Phase 2 – Outdoor Testing & Turning Optimization
**Status:** Completed ✅

- Battery fully charged
- Turning logic significantly improved
- Minor drift observed under motion

**Results:**
- Reliable RF range: ~45 meters
- Line-of-sight obstruction identified as main limitation
